# Welcome to Luc Perkins' GitHub profile! 👋🏼🐙

Hello, everyone! I'm a freelance software engineer and technical educator with a passion for making complex software systems dramatically more accessible for developers of all stripes. At the moment, my work is focused on:

- Data engineering (databases, messaging systems, SQL)
- Build systems ([Nix], [Bazel])
- Front-end development (front-end frameworks like [NextJS][next], [TypeScript], [Contentlayer])

Check out my [sponsors page][sponsors] to see how you can contribute to my efforts 💰. Even modest amounts are a huge help!
