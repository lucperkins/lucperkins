# Welcome to Luc Perkins' GitHub profile! 👋🏼🐙

Hello, everyone!
I'm a software engineer at [Determinate Systems][detsys] working on bringing [Nix] to the masses with [FlakeHub] and tools like the [Determinate Nix Installer][installer], the [Nix Flake Checker][checker], and the [Magic Nix Cache][magic].

I also retain a strong interest in databases and am a co-author of the second edition of [Seven Databases in Seven Weeks][7dbs].

Check out my [sponsors page][sponsors] if you'd like to contribute to my OSS efforts 💰, which include projects like [The Nix Way][way].
